#  I am Sridhar Reddy, I have been into Mobile Application testing since 2009. I am very passionate about Mobile Application Testing and Mobile Automation by using Appium/robotium and calabash.  
Here I am going to share my 10 experience which I have gained. 
When comes to Mobile automation - lot of issues. Especially when it comes to Device agnostics and device performance and navigation. To avoid Device agnostics and faster test case execution, I would like to share this project with you guys. 
I am sure this powerfull project will trun your existing Test automation framework into robust and will execute all your test cases in faster way. Or you can use this for building new Automation framework.
This project can easily integrate with any tool like Appium, calabash, see test...many more.
